Introduction to GitHub
This is an HTML file introducing GitHub from my personal perspective.
It’s amazing — I really like GitHub.
From what I know, GitHub is a platform that allows everyone, especially developers, to upload and write code to share with others for viewing, using, and commenting.
GitHub plays a very important and convenient role that every developer should know about.
